## Exercise 1:
Write a program `AboveAverage.java` that takes n integers from command-line, and prints the fraction of values that are strictly above the average value.
_(Interesting fact: 90% of incoming college students rate themselves as above average)._ 

## Exercise 2:
We'll say that an element in an array is "alone" if there are values before and after it, and those values are different from it. Write a program `NotAlone.java` that read n numbers from command line, store them in an array and return a version of the array where every instance of the given value which is alone is replaced by whichever value to its left or right is larger.

e.g.

[1, 2, 3] --> 1, 3, 3]

[1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2] --> [1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 2]

[3, 4] --> [3, 4]
