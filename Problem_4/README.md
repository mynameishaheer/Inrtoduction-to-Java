## Exercise 1:
# Write a program RollLoadedDie.java that prints the result of rolling a loaded die such that the probability of getting a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 is 1/8 and the probability of getting a 6 is 3/8.

## Exercise 2:
# Write a program Hurricane.java that that takes the wind speed (in miles per hour) as an integer command-line argument and prints whether it qualifies as a hurricane, and if so, whether it is a Category 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 hurricane. Below is a table of the wind speeds according to the Saffir-Simpson scale.

### Category ______ Wind Speed (mph)
### 1	     _______________   74 - 95
### 2       _______________	  96 - 110
### 3       _______________ 	111 - 130
### 4	     _______________   131 - 155
### 5	     _______________   156 and above

## Exercise 3:
## Write a program Harmonic.java that takes input an integer n from command line and output the nth harmonic number Hn= 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n.
