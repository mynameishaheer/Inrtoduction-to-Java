## Exercise 1:

Write a Java method `isValid.java` to check whether a string is a valid password.

**Password rules:**

A password must have at least ten characters.

A password consists of only letters and digits.

A password must contain at least two digits.

_**Hint: Use `Character.isLetter(char c)` and `Character.isDigit(char c)` methods to check whether a given character c is letter or digit respectively.**_


## Exercise 2:

Write a method `canBalance` that given a non-empty array, return true if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side.

canBalance([1, 1, 1, 2, 1]) is true

canBalance([2, 1, 1, 2, 1]) is false

canBalance([10, 10]) is true


## Exercise 3:

Write a method `isPalindrome` that returns true if and only if the input string is palindrome 

**_(A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar or the number 10201.)_**


## Bonus Exercise:

Generalize the method from previous exercise to sentence palindromes.

_**(In sentence-length palindromes, allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" or "No 'x' in Nixon")**_
