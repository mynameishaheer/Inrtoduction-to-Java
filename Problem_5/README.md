## Exercise 1:
Write a program `Hellos.java` that takes the number of lines to print as a command-line argument. You may assume that the argument is less than 1000. 

_Hint: consider using i % 10 and i % 100 to determine whether to use "st", "nd", "rd", or "th" for printing the ith Hello._

### Example:
```
% java Hellos 4

1st Hello
2nd Hello
3rd Hello
4th Hello
```

## Exercise 2:
Write a program `FivePerLine.java` that, using one for loop and one if statement, prints the integers from 1000 to 2000 with five integers per line. Only last line may have less than 5 numbers.

_Hint: use the % operator._

## Bonus Exercise:
A couple beginning a family decides to keep having children until they have at least one of either sex. Assume that the probability p of having a boy or girl is 1/2. Find total number of children by simulation.
