## Exercise 1:
Given array of integers, write a program `MinDiff.java` that print a pair of numbers with smallest absolute difference.

_Ex: {50, 1, 7, 25, 9 } -> (7,9)_

## Exercise 2:

Write a program `RemoveLetters.java` which given a string, creates a new string with all the consecutive duplicates removed.

_Ex: ABBCCCCCBBAB -> ABCBAB._

## Exercise 3:

Write a program `Scramble.java` that takes as input a string and output another string with the same first and last letter but internal letters of the original string in random order.

_Ex:._ 

_important -> iprmoetnt_

_right -> rghit_

_English -> Elingsh_


**_Note: Use the shuffling algorithm in Deck.java for the shuffling part._**
