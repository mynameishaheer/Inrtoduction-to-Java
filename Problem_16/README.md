## Exercise 1:

Write a recursive function that takes in one argument n and computes Fn , the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence. Recall that the Fibonacci sequence is defined by the relation Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 where F0 = 0 and F1 = 1


## Exercise 2

Write a recursive method to sum all elements in a given array.

_**Hint: implement the following recursive function.**_

```
// this function find the sum of first n elements of array

  public static int sum(int[] a, int n) {

    if(n==____) return _____; // base case

    int s = _________; // recursively find the sum of n-1 elements 

    return s + ____; // return s + the last element

  }
```

## Exercise 3:

Write a recursive method that returns true if and only if the input string is palindrome 

_**(A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar or the number 10201.)**_
