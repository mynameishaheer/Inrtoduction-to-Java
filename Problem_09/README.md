## Exercise 1:
Write a program `showTwos.java` that shows the factors of 2 in an integer given at command-line.

e.g.
```
% java showTwos 7

7 = 7
```
```
% java showTwos 18

18 = 2 * 9
```
```
% java showTwos 68

68 = 2 * 2 * 17
```
```
% java showTwos 120

120 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 15
```
## Exercise 2:
Write a program named `digitSum.java` that accepts an integer as a parameter and prints the sum of the digits of that number. For example, `% java digitSum 29107` prints 19 because 2+9+1+0+7=19. For negative numbers, return the same value that would result if the number were positive. For example, `% java digitSum -456` prints 15 which is 4+5+6. 

## Exercise 3:
Write a program named `daysInMonth.java` that accepts a month _(an integer between 1 and 12)_ as a parameter and prints the number of days in that month in this year. For example, the call `% java daysInMonth 9` would print 30 because September has 30 days. Assume that the code is not being run during a leap year _(that February always has 28 days)_.

Month	Jan	Feb	Mar	Apr	May	Jun	Jul	Aug	Sep Oct Nov Dec

Days	 31 	28  	31  	30  	31  	30  	31  	31  	30  	31  	30  	31
