## Exercise 1:
Given an array of integers, write a program `Ones.java` to find the maximum number of consecutive 1's present in the array.

e.g,

{1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1} --> 4

{0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1} --> 1 

## Exercise 2:
Write a Java program `Zeros.java` to move all 0's to the end of an array. Maintain the relative order of the other _(non-zero)_ array elements.
