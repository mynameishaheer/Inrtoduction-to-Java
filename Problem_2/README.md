## Exercise 1:
# Write a program Distance.java that takes two integer command-line arguments x and y and prints the Euclidean distance from the point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0).


## Exercise 2:
# Write a program Stats3.java that prints three uniform random values between 0 and 1, their average value, and their minimum and maximum value. Use Math.random(), Math.min(), and Math.max().


## Exercise 3:
# Three-sort. Write a program ThreeSort.java that takes three int values from the command line and prints them in ascending order. Use Math.min() and Math.max().
